# Blip & Blop: Rearmed Edition

A patched, actively-maintained continuation of the 2002 freeware game
*Blip'n Blop* (see the "Blip'n Blop" section below for the original
project's own history). Same jank, same charm — minus the bugs that
made parts of it genuinely unplayable on a modern PC.

## What changed in this pass

Real, verified bugs fixed — not just modernization:

- **Screen shake was silently disabled** ("works unproperly at least on
  Linux") over a self-overlapping surface blit, not anything
  Linux-specific. Root-caused and re-enabled.
- **Rain/weather distortion** had the same self-overlap bug, plus an
  independent second bug — a whole direction branch had been commented
  out, corrupting the effect on roughly half of all frames.
- **The "GO" arrow could appear before its scroll lock actually
  released** — an idle-nudge timer that fired independently of the
  real unlock condition, making it look like the screen froze for a
  moment right after clearing a locked arena.
- **Music volume did nothing, on any platform** — `Mp3Music::set_volume()`
  was a hardcoded no-op. Real, working volume controls added (music
  and SFX independently, 0–100% in steps of 10, in Options).
- **A malformed config file left key bindings showing as "UNDEFINED"**
  instead of falling back to sane defaults.
- **Rebinding RETURN or ESCAPE to a movement key in the Keys menu could
  corrupt every menu in the game at once** (both are also checked
  directly for confirm/cancel everywhere else) — now rejected outright,
  and an already-corrupted saved config file self-heals on load.
- **The 2nd/4th/… gamepad never worked at all** — a one-character
  operator-precedence bug (`&` vs `>`) in the input layer.
- A couple of menu-navigation bugs: leaving P1/P2 Keys could land you
  back in the wrong screen, and cancelling out of certain setup flows
  could leave stray input that fired the wrong item on the next menu.

Quality of life:

- **Runs in a proper Full HD window by default** (1920×1080, fullscreen,
  borderless) instead of the old DirectDraw-era resolution dance — no
  more fighting the taskbar/Alt-Tab just to minimize. The game area
  itself is still the original 640×480 4:3 playfield, pillarboxed
  rather than stretched — see "Explored and reverted" below for why.
- A real application icon instead of the SDL default.
- Removed the in-game "Toggle Fullscreen" option — it kept glitching no
  matter how it was implemented, so it's gone rather than shipped
  broken. The game still starts in fullscreen by default; there's just
  no live in-game toggle anymore.

Explored and reverted (kept here for transparency, and because the
work is still sitting in git history if anyone wants to pick it back
up):

- A full peer-to-peer network multiplayer implementation — ENet
  transport, a Host/Join UI, mid-match disconnect handling, a trimmed
  player-position/RNG-seed sync layer — got as far as actually working
  over a LAN before being reverted as too large a scope for this pass.
  Reliable full world-state sync (enemies, bonuses, level events, not
  just the two players) would need substantially more work than a
  drive-by pass could responsibly deliver.
- A true widescreen internal resolution (854×480 instead of 640×480).
  Enemy/object spawn timing turned out to be baked into the level
  files as raw pixel offsets tuned for the original 640px screen, so
  widening it broke spawn timing across every level in ways that
  couldn't be fixed without hand-editing binary level data — reverted
  in favor of the pillarboxed Full HD window described above.

## Building

Requires a C++17 compiler and SDL2 + SDL2_mixer.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

### Windows

* Visual Studio (MSVC), CMake, and [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
* Install dependencies: `vcpkg install sdl2:x64-windows sdl2-mixer:x64-windows`
* Configure with the vcpkg toolchain file, then build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<path-to-vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Linux

* GCC or Clang, CMake, `libsdl2-dev`, `libsdl2-mixer-dev` (e.g. `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

# Forker's notes

I am mainly trying to modernize the code. Both in terms of C++ features, and
features (mainly trying not to lock the game in 640x480, adding a few shaders
and stuff).

As the code is kinda old, there's a lot of revamping to do, and a lot of
optimizations done back in the days shouldn't be relevant anymore. The code
contains a FUCKTON of global variables, to the point where I'm in awe that
somehow the game works flawlessly. The quantity of global variables declared
and handled all over the places is truly unmanageable.

As a french, I can work my way through the code, and although I'll be
translating comments as I skim through it, there are some really funny gems
that I'd rather not translate as they'd break the stupidity that made Blip'n
Blop famous. I would rather have a separate lexicon for the fellas that can't
french.

This project is HUGE for two students. Kudos to you guys, it's a LOT of work,
and even if the quality is, uh, debatable, the game actually works flawlessly
and you undeniably got the work done. I can hardly believe every single error
has been handled, even memory allocation failures, so that the game wouldn't
crash (some, including me, would say that it's easier for a developper to
handle a crash, rather than propagating / circumventing silently an error that
would still disallow the gamer to properly play the game). Congrats and thanks!

## Lexicon

- Couille: testicle. That's what the players are, and the code is in
  couille.{cpp,h}
- schnuff: "thing". It's not french, it's a made up word, don't look at me like
  that
- snuf: Smurf?
- Tête de turc: a person that gets all the hate. In the game engine, the
  enemies are fighting one of the two couilles at a time, who is then called
  "la tête de turc". See `Game::tete_turc`

## When I laughed

- "couille" in the code
- "schnuff"
- Tête de turc. That's kinda informal and slang.
- `SuperListe` (=AwesomeList). And it's actually really not awesome, it's a
  `void*` based linked list with an embedded STATEFUL iterator. I'm sad I have
  to remove it to use actual vectors.
- `SuperListe::vide_porc`: empty (like a?) pork, meaning "in an unclean way".
  IDK why, the code is exactly the same as the unporked version.
- `SuperListe::supprime_porc`: removes an element of the list without freeing
  its memory (ie, it's a non-owning list)
- 'Gère les messages. Eh oui, Windows pue du cul' (Handles messages. Yeah,
  Windows' ass stinks, nota: Ben Karaban apparently works for MS now)
- A variable is named 'glorf'.
- "Gère le scrolling avec le super buffer qui marche bizarrement sur cette
  merde de GeForce." (Handles scrolling with the awesome buffer that works
  weirdly on this shitty GeForce)
- After a failed `new`, in a log message: "Nani? Not enough memory???"
- "Affiche les têtes de con" (Show the fucktard' faces)
- "Destructeur -> On est pas des Brujahs..."

## Significant differences

- The menus were a big pile of switch case in a single class. The pause menu
  and the title screen menu were just a big copy paste. I cleaned up all that.
  Take a look at `menus/`. Pause menu and title screen menu are now the same
  thing
- Added a "TOGGLE FULLSCREEN" option.
- Fixed a bug that prevented unix like os from playing. Some level descriptions
  contained path containing backslashes that failed. Now backslashes are
  handled.
- MusicBank has been reworked a lot
- For some reasons, there were (and still are) too many nonsensical bridges in
  this code. There's a Direct3D simulated API implented in SDL, a FMOD fake API
  implemented in SDL mixer, and a windows API implemented with Linux syscalls.
  I guess those came from the first revamping of the code in 2014; the
  developper must have thought that implementing a bridge would be easier than
  manipulating the code.

# Blip'n Blop
This is the source code of Blip'n Blop, a free video game for the PC released in 2002. Years after the game got released, some enthusiastic programmers asked us to open source it and here we are!

A few things to keep in mind:
- this was writen when we were still students so the code quality and the (lack of) architecture can be disturbing
- the code is mostly written in a terrible mix of french and english, which should be kind of akward to read for non french speaking people (actually, it's kind of awkward even for french people! :p )
- the various editors can be quite complicated to get working because they relied on various cryptic INI files
